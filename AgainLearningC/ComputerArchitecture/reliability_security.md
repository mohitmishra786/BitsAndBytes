# Reliability & Security in Computing

## Fundamentals of System Reliability

- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Average time between system failures.
- **Availability**: Measure of the system uptime relative to total time.

## Security Principles

- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)**: Core principles of information security.

## Techniques for Enhancing Reliability & Security

- **Redundancy**: Duplication of critical components to increase reliability.
- **Encryption**: Protecting data both at rest and in transit.

## Recent Sentiment on X regarding Security

- Discussions often revolve around the balance between user convenience and security measures, with new breaches prompting calls for stronger encryption and decentralized security solutions.
