# Parallel Processing

## Introduction to Parallel Processing

- **Definition**: Parallel processing involves the simultaneous use of more than one CPU or processor core to execute a program or multiple computational threads.

## Types of Parallelism

- **Data Parallelism**: Same operation performed on different data elements simultaneously.
- **Task Parallelism**: Different operations or tasks executed on different processors.

## Architectures

- **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)**: Multiple identical processors share memory and connect via a bus.
- **Massively Parallel Processors (MPP)**: Many processors with their own memory and an interconnect network.

## Challenges

- **Synchronization**: Coordinating between parallel processes/threads.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensuring all processors are equally utilized.
- **Scalability**: How well performance increases with more processors.

## Parallel Programming Models

- **MPI (Message Passing Interface)**: Standard for distributed memory systems.
  - [MPI on Wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface)
  
- **OpenMP**: For shared memory multiprocessing.
  - [OpenMP Official Site](openmp.org)

- **CUDA**: For GPU parallel computing developed by NVIDIA.
  - [CUDA Documentation](docs.nvidia.com/cuda/)
