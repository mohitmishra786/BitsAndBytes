## Standards
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 - Information technology -- Microprocessor Systems -- Floating-Point arithmetic**
  - Not freely available, but it's the international standard for binary floating-point arithmetic

## Code Example
```python
# Binary to Decimal conversion
binary = "1010"
decimal = int(binary, 2)
print(f"Binary {binary} is equal to Decimal {decimal}")

# Decimal to Hexadecimal conversion
decimal = 42
hexadecimal = hex(decimal)
print(f"Decimal {decimal} is equal to Hexadecimal {hexadecimal}")
```

## Note
Understanding number systems is fundamental to computer science and forms the basis for data representation in digital systems. It's crucial to master conversions between different bases and arithmetic operations in various number systems.
