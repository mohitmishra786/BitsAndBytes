  - Not freely available, but it's relevant for hardware description and verification of datapaths and control units

## Note
Understanding the datapath and control unit is fundamental to computer architecture. The datapath performs the actual operations on data, while the control unit manages the flow of data and instructions through the processor. This topic forms the basis for understanding more advanced concepts in processor design and optimization.
