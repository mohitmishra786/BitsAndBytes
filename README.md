# BitsAndBytes

A comprehensive collection of low-level programming examples and system programming concepts, featuring implementations of memory management, concurrency patterns, and OS internals in C.

The repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference implementation for systems programming concepts, with a focus on performance optimization and hardware interaction.
