# Power & Energy Consumption

## Understanding Power Consumption in Computing

- **Dynamic Power**: Power consumed by switching activity in circuits.
- **Static Power**: Due to leakage currents in transistors.

## Strategies for Reducing Power Consumption

- **Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)**: Adjusts power based on demand.
- **Power Gating**: Shutting off parts of the chip not in use.

## Tools for Measuring Energy Use

- **Powerstat**: Tool for Ubuntu to measure power usage.
- **Intel Power Gadget**: For real-time energy monitoring on Intel processors.
