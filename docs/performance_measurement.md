# Performance Measurement

## Introduction to Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: Number of processes completed per unit time.
- **Latency**: Time taken to respond to a request or complete a task.

## Tools for Measurement

- **Benchmarking Tools**: Synthetic tests like SPEC, Geekbench.
- **Profiling Tools**: gprof, perf, VTune for detailed analysis of CPU usage.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **CPU Usage**: Percentage of time CPU spends on non-idle tasks.
- **Memory Usage**: Amount of memory used versus available memory.
- **Disk I/O**: Read/write speeds, IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).

## Recent Sentiment on X about Performance Tools

- Discussion on the effectiveness of modern benchmarking tools in capturing real-world performance, especially with newer, more complex workloads like AI training.
