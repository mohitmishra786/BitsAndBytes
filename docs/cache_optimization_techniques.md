# Cache Optimization Techniques

## Overview of Cache Optimization

- **Goal**: Minimize the time it takes to fetch data from memory by optimizing for cache behavior.

## Key Techniques

- **Loop Tiling**: Restructuring loops to fit data into cache and reuse it effectively.
  - Example in C:
    ```c
    for (int kk = 0; kk < N; kk += BLOCK_SIZE)
      for (int jj = 0; jj < N; jj += BLOCK_SIZE)
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
          for (int j = jj; j < jj + BLOCK_SIZE && j < N; j++)
            // operate on data block
    ```

- **Data Prefetching**: Fetching data into the cache before it's needed to reduce latency.

- **Reducing Cache Misses**: Structuring data access patterns to increase cache hits through locality of reference.

## Tools for Cache Analysis

- **Cachegrind**: A cache profiler, part of Valgrind.
- **Intel VTune Amplifier**: For detailed performance analysis including cache usage.
