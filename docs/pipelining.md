## Note
Pipelining is a key technique for improving processor performance by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. Understanding pipelining, including concepts like hazards (structural, data, control) and their solutions (forwarding, stalling, branch prediction), is crucial for designing and optimizing modern processors. It forms the basis for more advanced techniques like superscalar and out-of-order execution.
