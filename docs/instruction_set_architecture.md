## Standards
- **IEEE 1754-1994 - IEEE Standard for a 32-Bit Microprocessor Architecture**
  - Not freely available, but it's an example of a standardized ISA

## Code Example (RISC-V Assembly)
```assembly
# Simple RISC-V assembly program to add two numbers
.global _start

.text
_start:
    li a0, 10       # Load immediate value 10 into register a0
    li a1, 20       # Load immediate value 20 into register a1
    add a2, a0, a1  # Add a0 and a1, store result in a2

    # Exit program
    li a7, 93       # System call number for exit
    ecall           # Make system call
```

## Note
Understanding ISA is crucial for both hardware designers and software developers. It defines the interface between hardware and software, influencing aspects such as performance, power efficiency, and programming complexity. Different ISAs (like RISC and CISC) have their own design philosophies and trade-offs.
